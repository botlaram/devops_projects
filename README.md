# Building a docker container via GitHub Actions

This project is about creating Docker Image using GitActions.

We will use Python 3.10 and create a Flask web server that serves an `index.html` file. GitHub Actions will be used to automate the container building process, ensuring that the container is built consistently with every code change.

Prerequisites:

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* A GitHub account
